## Oh hai 👋🏻

I'm **Angelique Weger**, and I'm keen on solving problems with code + teaching others to do the same.

I currently help build courseware for [Lumen Learning](https://lumenlearning.com/), where we want to enable unprecedented learning for all students. My focus is on front-end code, accessibility, and growing the best possible team for this task.

I also teach front-end web development at [MICA](https://mica.edu) in their graphic design department.

### About me
- 👉🏻 &nbsp;&nbsp;My pronouns are she/her.
- 💖 &nbsp;&nbsp;In 2021, I still love Sass.
- 🌮 &nbsp;&nbsp;I deeply love tacos and once at at least a taco a day for a whole month ([#SpringIntoTacos](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/springintotacos/) chronicles this adventure on Instagram).
