## Oh hai 👋🏻

I'm **Angelique Weger**, and I'm keen on solving problems with code + teaching others to do the same.

I currently work as an engineering manager and also teach front-end web development at [MICA](https://mica.edu) in their graphic design department.

### About me
- 👉🏻 &nbsp;&nbsp;My pronouns are she/her.
- 🌮 &nbsp;&nbsp;I deeply love tacos and once at at least a taco a day for a whole month.
